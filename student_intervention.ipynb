    "    - Provides flexibility in terms of choosing the kernel function.\n",

    "Following are the weekness of the model:\n",
    "    - Training time is more when compaired with other supervised learning.\n",
    "    - If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances.\n",
    "    - It does not work very well if there is a noise in the dataset\n",

    "2.Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",

Basically a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. Navie Bayes model is simple and easy to build partiularly for very large data sets.\n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

Then, depending on where the testing data lands on either side of the line, that’s how we classify the fruit as either apple or cherry. However there could be mulitple ways we could split this decision boundary. This is where SVM strenght is, it maximises the distances between nearest data point (either class) and hyper-plane will help us to decide the right hyper-plane. This distance is called as Margin. SVM always tries to maxmise the margin."
